	ORGANISED CRIME

				D Fail (0.5) The politician is dead. Sadly, he made arrangements. The diplomatic community will be made aware of your recent criminal activity.
					Moderate penalty to diplomatic reputation



		THE CONTAGION OF CRIME- requires shared border or migration treaty {ideally likelihood of getting this event will be linked to how many times the organised crime option has been used against the targeted empire}

			OPENER: There has been a spike in criminal activity throughout the empire. Reports suggest it may be linked to a powerful crime syndicate on [target planet] within [target empire]. Our [network] has been supporting them for some time. 

				A: Brief our domestic agents. We must deal with this quietly. (requires alpha or beta domestic operations)
				B: Our [network] has contacts. Surely we can reach an agreement that's profitable for all.	
				C: A few more criminals is of no concern to us. The police can handle this. 
				D: We will root them out with force! (unusuable by pacifists) {optional, if you're smort}

			ENDING 
				A Success (0.8 for domestic funding policy, 0.5 for balanced and 0.3 for foreign funding)
				Our [domestic network] has successfully traced the syndicate to a district on [ownrandomplanet]. They were able to shut the operation down and seize their "merchanise". 
					Gain 100 of a random strategic resource, and X5 small artifacts {or whatever you think is balanced}. Continue support organised crime.

				A Fail
				Our Domestic Network was unable to prevent the syndicate from infiltrating our empire further. Crime activity in the capital and [ownrandomplanet] is rising. 
					Crime increases by 1.5X normal in [capital] and [ownrandomplanet]. Support organised crime continues. 

				B Success (0.8 for foreign funding policy, 0.5 for balanced and 0.3 for domestic funding)
				Our agents on [targetplanet] have been able to strike a deal with the syndicate. Hopefully it will be worth the rise in crime it has caused. 
					Crime increases by 1.5X normal in [capital] and [ownrandomplanet]. 2X normal energy credit reward for support organised crime. Support organised crime continues.

				B Fail
				The syndicate responded to our messages with the heads of our [nework] agents. They are clearly not interested in sharing their profits.  
					Crime increases by 1X normal in [targetplanet], [capital] and [ownrandomplanet]. Support organised crime ends. 

				C: Organised Crime activity has risen in the capital and [randomtargetplanet]. 
					1.5X increase in crime activity on [capital] and [randomtargetplanet]. Support organised crime resumes. 

				D: Our military intelligence were able to trace criminal activity to [ownrandomplanet]. During their mission to destroy the outpost, several operatives escaped on ships disguised as civillian freighters. Several transport and cargo vessels have been reported missing in the area. 
					Support organised crime resumes. Pirates spawned in system adjacent to [ownrandomplanet].
